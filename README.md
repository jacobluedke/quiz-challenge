# Quiz Challenge 

##Description

Upon clicking the start button, this webpage should start a timer and change from the "start" section to the "quiz" section with the first question ready to be answered. 

After clicking on the desired answer, the score increases if the answer was correct or remains unchanged if the answer was incorrect. After making a selection, the next question appears.

This process is reapeated until either the time runs out or there are no more questions to be answered.

Once the quiz is finished, the "highscores" sections pops up and the "quiz" section is removed. Then the users score is logged in the highscores ordered list.
